          <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">What is mortgage insurance?</a>
          <div class="uk-accordion-content">
            <p>Mortgage insurance is an insurance borrowers are required to pay when a down payment of less than 20% is made on the purchase of a home or when a borrower is refinancing and has less than 20% in equity (Equity is the cash value of a
              house after it is sold and all debts have been paid off).</p>
            <p>Mortgage insurance on FHA loans is mandatory and is never taken off. Conventional loans allow you to have it removed once 20% equity has been reached either by paying down mortgage debt or by having the value of the property go up
              enough. In some conventional loans, the borrower may be offered “lender paid mortgage insurance” which means the lender will pay your mortgage insurance but will result in a higher interest rate which will offset the benefit of having
              lender paid mortgage insurance. Most of the time it is better to pay mortgage insurance instead of having a higher interest rate.</p>

          <div class="uk-accordion-content">
            <p>Mortgage insurance payments will depend on several factors and can be higher for some people and lower for others such as:</p>
            <ul class=" ">
              <li>High or low credit score</li>
              <li>Substantial down payment very a low down payment</li>

          <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">What is a loan application?</a>
          <div class="uk-accordion-content">
            <p>This application is required and necessary when a you apply for a mortgage. It has all the necessary information a lender needs in order to determine if you are credit worthy and what types of credit terms you will have like the
              interest rate, minimum down payment requirements, possible amortization terms.
            </p>
            <p>All mortgage applications are accompanied by disclosures and are necessary to have a complete loan package.</p>
            <p>In this digital era, most loan applications are completed digitally and signed on a computer or on a smart phone. You can complete a physical application but digital documentation makes for a faster and easier process for you as the
              borrower.</p>

              <li>* An underwriter is a person representing the lender who reviews and approves or denies a home loan. Clear-to-close means there are no more documents or steps needed to close the loan and closing date can be scheduled.</li>

          <div class="uk-accordion-content">
            <p>Mortgage loans can be done completely paperless now. From the pre-qualification process to the application, and now even the closing. Closings can be done via computer with a notary explaining the all closing documents and verifying
              identity. Everything has changed and become much faster and easier for both lenders and borrowers. Take advantage of our digital capabilities and learn as much as possible to how the process works and what needs to be done. This is a
              major advantage when competing for a home as you will be able to provide pre-approval letters and loan approvals in hours not days or weeks.

          <div class="uk-accordion-content">
            <p>A preapproval letter is a letter that the mortgage loan officer or bank representative provides a borrower and/or realtor, in order to show that the borrower has the capacity to purchase that home at that price as long as they are able
              to provide all the necessary documents requested by the bank.
            </p>
            <p>This is an important letter when trying to beat other buyer's on a home that’s for sale.

            <p>An appraisal is an estimate of value of real estate completed by a licensed appraiser and is a very important step in the purchase process. In a mortgage, both the borrower needs to be approved and the house needs to appraise and be in
              a satisfactory condition for the bank. This means that if the borrower is purchasing a home worth $500,000, the appraisal must come back for at least $500,000 or more.

            <p>No, not everyone qualifies for a home mortgage but most people do over time since they can always save for the down payment or increase their income by getting another job or moving to a higher position at work. Borrowers can also hire
              a credit repair company that can help them have the necessary credit to qualify for the rates available.

            <p>Interest rates are not calculated at random. They are risk based. There are several key factors that determine the rate which a borrower will have. Some of these are:

              <li>Property type. Houses will get you the best rates, town homes will have slightly lower rates, and condominiums or apartments will have the highest rates.</li>
              <li>Property use. If you are planning on living in the home you will have the lowest rate since you represent the lowest risk to the bank. This is known as your “Primary residence” or your “Owner occupied home”. If you are planning on
                using the property as a vacation or second home, then you will have higher rates. Finally, if you are purchasing or refinancing an investment property, rates will be the highest of all three.</li>
